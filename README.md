# ineedmymeds

Open Data BC Hackathon 2018 Project. ineedmymeds crowdsources information about medication availability from different pharmacies.


## Why this is needed?

* Medication shortages happen all the time.
* There’s no way to predict these shortages
* What happens if you need a medication but it’s not available in your pharmacy?
    * The pharmacy calls the nearest X pharmacies to see if anyone has it
    * It's unrealistic for your pharmacy to call the hundreds of other pharmacies in the city so the patient is left without access to that medication

## Built With

* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) - Our backend API is a Flask App which responds to requests in JSON
* [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/) - Our front end is a React.js app that communicates with the Flask API.
